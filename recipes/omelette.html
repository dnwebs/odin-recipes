    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An omelette (or omelet in American English) is a dish made from beaten eggs cooked in a pan. The main ingredients
        are eggs and butter or oil for frying. It is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed plain or with various
        fillings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, Gruyère, Swiss, etc.), optional</li>
        <li>Optional fillings (cooked vegetables, meats, or herbs), see suggestions below</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Beat the eggs vigorously</strong> with a fork until fully combined and seasoned with salt and
            pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat</strong>, add butter, and swirl to coat. Pour in the
            eggs and swirl to
            distribute.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover and cook until the eggs begin to set.</strong> Use a spatula to gently push cooked edges
            towards the center,
            letting uncooked egg flow underneath until mostly set.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip the omelette</strong>, turn off the heat, add cheese and toppings to one half.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold the other half over the fillings</strong>, slide onto a plate, and serve. Garnish as desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Omelette Filling Suggestions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> sautéed mushrooms, spinach, diced tomatoes, caramelized onions, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Meats:</strong> cooked crumbled sausage, bacon, ham, smoked salmon, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Cheddar, Gruyère, Swiss, American, gouda, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Herbs:</strong> Chives, dill, parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid overcooking; the omelette is done when set but still moist.</li>
        <li>Use a nonstick skillet with sloping sides.</li>
        <li>Limit fillings to no more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup for a 2-3 egg omelette.</li>
        <li>Prepare fillings before starting.</li>
        <li>For a French omelette, use medium-low heat, stir gently while cooking, and roll instead of flipping.</li>
    </ul>
