    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish. It's made with stacked layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, fillings, and
        sauces, then baked. It's a popular comfort food worldwide with a rich history and numerous variations.</p>
    <h3>Main Components</h3>
    <p><strong>Noodles:</strong> Wide, flat pasta sheets form the dish's base. Modern recipes often use no-boil noodles,
        but traditionally, noodles are boiled al dente.</p>
    <p><strong>Sauce:</strong> Typically, a rich meat sauce like Bolognese or a simple marinara sauce is used. This
        often includes tomatoes (crushed, sauce, and paste) for flavor. Some variations also incorporate béchamel (a
        creamy white sauce) for added richness.</p>
    <p><strong>Cheese:</strong> A blend of cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan is commonly used to create
        creamy, melty layers.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Brown the ground beef (and sausage, if using) in a large skillet or pot.</li>
                <li>Drain any excess fat.</li>
                <li>Sauté the onion and garlic until softened.</li>
                <li>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, and other desired seasonings.</li>
                <li>Simmer the sauce for a period to allow flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Lasagna Noodles (if not using no-boil)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Boil the noodles in a large pot of salted water until al dente.</li>
                <li>Drain the noodles and rinse them with cold water to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on a surface like wax or parchment paper.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, and any other desired seasonings like
                    parsley.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe (commonly around 375°F or 190°C).</li>
                <li>Lightly grease your baking dish.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish.</li>
                <li>Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly if necessary.</li>
                <li>Spread a portion of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Top the ricotta mixture with a layer of meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of mozzarella cheese slices or shredded mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layering process, building several layers of noodles, ricotta, sauce, and mozzarella.
                </li>
                <li>Finish with a top layer of noodles, sauce, and remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>If using no-boil noodles and your sauce is thick, consider adding a little water around the edges of
                    the pan.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Lasagna</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with foil. To prevent the cheese from sticking, you can spray the underside of
                    the foil with cooking spray or tent it.</li>
                <li>Bake for the time recommended in your recipe (often around 30-45 minutes).</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and continue baking until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the top is golden
                    brown.</li>
                <li>You can broil for a few minutes at the end for an extra browned and bubbly top, if desired.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving. This allows the layers to
                    set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
