    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French toast is a popular dish made by soaking sliced bread in a mixture of beaten eggs, and often milk or cream,
        before pan-frying it until golden brown
        . It's enjoyed worldwide, often as a sweet breakfast or brunch item, though savory versions also exist.</p>
    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>Though the name suggests otherwise, French toast didn't originate in France. The earliest known recipe dates back
        to the Roman Empire, where bread was soaked in milk and fried. In France, the dish is known as "pain perdu" or
        "lost bread," referring to the use of stale bread. It is believed that the name "French toast" became popular in
        America due to French immigrants. One anecdote suggests that an innkeeper named Joseph French coined the term,
        intending to call it "French's toast" but omitting the apostrophe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
        <li>8 thick slices of bread, preferably a couple of days old. Options include sourdough, challah, brioche, or
            whole-grain.</li>
        <li>Butter (or oil) for frying</li>
        <li>Maple syrup and/or powdered sugar for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the batter:</strong> In a shallow dish, whisk together the eggs, milk, cinnamon, and any
            other desired
            flavorings like vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Soak the bread:</strong> Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, ensuring both sides are
            coated. Some suggest
            letting the bread soak for a few minutes for a creamier texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the French toast:</strong> Melt butter in a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Place
            the soaked bread
            slices in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Top with desired toppings like butter, maple syrup, fresh berries, powdered sugar,
            or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Variations and Toppings</h2>
    <p>French toast can be customized with various toppings and ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sweet:</strong> Fresh berries, caramelized bananas, apple butter, chocolate chips, whipped cream,
            maple syrup,
            powdered sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Savory:</strong> Bacon, eggs, cheese, sauteed mushrooms and onions, ham, chorizo.</li>
        <li><strong>Unique coatings:</strong> Try dipping the soaked bread in crushed cereal before frying for added
            crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy options:</strong> Use whole wheat bread, skim milk, or egg whites to reduce fat and
            calories.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tips for making the best French toast</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use day-old bread:</strong> Stale bread absorbs the batter better, preventing sogginess.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider bread type:</strong> Challah or brioche are great choices for their fluffy texture and
            ability to soak up
            the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Soaking time:</strong> Allow the bread to soak in the egg mixture for a few minutes for a creamy
            center.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry with butter and oil:</strong> Using a mix can prevent butter from burning and adds richness.
